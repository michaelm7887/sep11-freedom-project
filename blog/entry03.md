# Entry 3
##### 02/03/35

Thoughout the blog entrys that I have missed, I have been learning my tool using a playlist form a youtuber(https://www.youtube.com/@swestover)using his playlist as a refrence and a guide into helping me understanding my tool and how I can use it with my project.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqMIGGy5YiE&list=PLmcXe0-sfoShHpVWLDW2gqsyH1UFRni_2)I didn't really have a winter break goal, but what I have been doing over the winter break was to continue my learning and expanding my Freedom project work using jsbin and doing code alongs with the videos in the playlist. Watching throughout the videos giving me phaser code examples that would help me for the FP, throughtout the days I have learnt codes, an example would be:
```js
this.#cursorKeys.up.isUp
```
where if someone presses on the up key the character/object would move up, and it would be the same for the rest of the keys were right would mean it would go right, etc. Following through there would be another code that works with said code which is:
```js
gravity: { y: 0, x: 0 }
```
Using gravity it controls how to character/object moves if it floats away or it just stays put. So currently I'm trying to figure out why my ship isn't showing up I will keep looking throught the videos and figure out if there is a small piece of code that I'm missing.
