So the tool I have decided on was "phaser", I chose it because it was the tool that had the projected I imaged. The way I have tinkered with my tool was making a file named phaser-3-space-shooter. With a help of a youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqMIGGy5YiE&list=PLmcXe0-sfoShHpVWLDW2gqsyH1UFRni_2), in the videos it gives a tutorial on how I can do my project step by step with them explaning on the codes they have used.
